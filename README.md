Easily create multiple columns within posts and pages.

newspaper/magazine-style layout.  Post and page columns are easily styled
with two CSS classes and two custom quicktags which are created automatically 
upon plugin installation.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the `mish_wp_columnize` folder to the your plugins directory,  
typically `/wp-content/plugins/`.
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress


== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does it work using the Visual Editor? =

Yes, except you'll have to manually type the column quicktags, `[col-sect]` and `[column]`
and their corresponding closing tags.

= Do you provide support for the plugin? =

Yes!  Just drop a line on the plugin site in the comments section.

= I don't know much about CSS... =

The plugin homepage provides an example of styling to use.
